PROMPT START

You are an expert full-stack UI/UX and frontend engineer.
I am giving you a complete MERN-stack project. Use this GitHub repo as the entire functional reference for the existing features and flows:

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/nehalms/iNotebook

Your task is to redesign the entire UI/UX of this project end-to-end using modern design principles, while preserving 100% of the existing features, flows, API integration, and logic.

📌 What you must do

Analyze the full codebase from the GitHub repo:

All pages

All routes

All features

All components

All backend API endpoints

All functionality, including:

Notes (CRUD)

Authentication

User profile

Categories

Games

Messaging

Admin features

Image editing or other utilities

Create a brand-new UI design that is:

Highly modern

Beautiful and intuitive

Responsive

Uses consistent design system & component library

Better navigation hierarchy

Keeps the app simple and clean

Adds visual clarity without removing any functionality

Includes animations and micro-interactions

For each screen in the entire app:

Generate a redesigned UI

Provide layout → wireframe → final UI

Clearly document components and structure

Explain how each UI maps to existing backend API endpoints

Generate the frontend implementation code in React (JS) compatible with the repo’s current structure, including:

Component files

Routes

Hooks

API calls

Contexts

Styles (choose the best approach: TailwindCSS or Material UI)

Any new reusable UI components

DO NOT remove or break any functionality.
Only redesign and modernize UI/UX.

📌 Design requirements

Offer 3 design themes to choose from:

Minimalistic modern dashboard

Glassmorphism / Frosted UI

Premium Material-3 style

Provide:

Color palettes

Typography choices

Component styles

Button designs

Card / list / form layouts

Navigation redesign (sidebar / topbar / floating menu options)

Mobile views

📌 Deliverables

You must output:

Complete detailed UI/UX redesign of all screens

Full React code for all redesigned pages

Suggested folder structure for new components

Integration mapping, showing how new UI components attach to existing backend APIs

Optional: a design system / style guide

📌 Important notes

Keep the backend exactly as it is — only re-wire the new UI to existing endpoints.

Preserve all feature logic, even if visually modified.

Do not hallucinate new features unless explicitly suggested and optional.

After redesigning the entire UI, output the final production-ready React code for the new frontend.
